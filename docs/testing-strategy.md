# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `downloads-server` project, ensuring the reliability, robustness, and maintainability of the application.

## Purpose of Testing

Testing is a critical part of the development lifecycle for `downloads-server`. It helps to:

- **Ensure Correctness:** Verify that the application behaves as expected and meets its functional requirements.
- **Prevent Regressions:** Catch bugs introduced by new features or refactoring efforts.
- **Improve Code Quality:** Encourage modular, testable, and maintainable code design.
- **Facilitate Refactoring:** Provide a safety net when making changes to existing code.
- **Enhance Confidence:** Build confidence in the application's stability and performance.

## Testing Levels

The project employs a multi-layered testing approach, covering different aspects of the application:

### 1. Unit Tests

- **Focus:** Testing individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Goal:** Verify the correctness of individual units of code, ensuring each performs its intended function correctly without external dependencies.
- **Principles:**
  - **Isolation:** Each test should run independently and not rely on the state of other tests.
  - **Mocking:** External dependencies (e.g., file system, network requests, database interactions, logging) are mocked to ensure true isolation and predictable test results.
  - **Granularity:** Tests should be small and focused on a single piece of functionality.
- **Location:** Unit tests are typically located in `__tests__` directories alongside the code they test (e.g., `src/managers/download/__tests__/`).
- unit tests **MUST** mock the logger module with an empty implementation to avoid testing logging behavior and to keep tests focused on core logic.

### 2. Integration Tests

- **Focus:** Testing the interactions between multiple integrated components or modules.
- **Goal:** Verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **Examples:** Testing the interaction between an API controller and a service layer, or a manager and its dependencies (excluding external systems that are mocked).

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Focus:** Testing the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
- **Goal:** Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure the complete system functions correctly, from API request to data persistence and response.
- **Scope:** These tests involve the full stack, including API endpoints, services, managers, and database interactions (using a test database).

## Testing Framework and Tools

- **Vitest:** The primary testing framework used for all levels of testing (Unit, Integration, E2E).
- **Mocking Libraries:** Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities are utilized for isolating units under test.

## Running Tests

All tests can be executed using the `pnpm` package manager:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This command will run all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests configured in the project.

## Test Coverage

Maintaining high test coverage is a goal for the `downloads-server` project. While 100% coverage is not always practical or necessary, efforts are made to ensure critical business logic and core functionalities are well-covered by tests. Test coverage reports can be generated to identify areas that require more testing.

## Best Practices

- **Descriptive Test Names:** Test names should clearly indicate what is being tested and what the expected outcome is.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):** Structure tests using the AAA pattern for clarity and readability.
- **Avoid Testing Implementation Details:** Focus on testing the observable behavior of the code rather than its internal implementation details.
- **Fast Feedback:** Strive for fast-running tests to enable quick feedback during development.
